1. Download main.py
2. Preferably add it to an empty folder to prevent file conflicts
3. Use online python compiler (I prefer onlinegdb.com) or run in your computers cmd if you have python installed

Game instructions:
When you are given a choice, to select that choice you type (in upper or lower case no spaces)the uppercase word.
Ex:
FIGHT
WALK away
If you want to fight you type "fight"
If you wanted to walk away you type "walk"

Note:
You can't really do much except move around 4 locations and get jumped randomly(15% chance) when moving between locations. Mess around with it see what can happen.
