1. Download main.py
2. Preferably add it to an empty folder to prevent file conflicts
3. Use online python compiler (I prefer onlinegdb.com) or run in your computers cmd if you have python installed

Note:
You can't really do much except move around 4 locations and get jumped randomly(15% chance) when moving between locations. Mess around with it see what can happen.
